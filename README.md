## 5 TIPS How to Fight with AI

1. **Know your enemy**

    The first step to fighting AI is to understand how it works. AI is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of technologies, so it's important to learn about the specific AI you're facing. Some things to consider include the AI's
    capabilities, limitations, and learning curve.

1. **Use your strengths**

    AI is good at some things, but it's not perfect. Exploit
    the AI's weaknesses and focus on your own strengths. For example, if the AI is good at pattern recognition, try to disrupt its patterns.

1. **Be creative**

    AI is predictable, so don't be afraid to think outside
    the box. Come up with new strategies and tactics that the AI won't be expecting.

1. **Don't give up**

    Take the time to personalize your communications. Address them by name, mention a specific point from their profile or previous conversation, and show genuine interest in their work or achievements.

1. **Don't be afraid to take risks**

    AI systems are risk-averse. They will typically play it safe and avoid taking chances. If you are willing to take risks, you can catch them off guard.

**ðŸ‘Š Don't let AI outsmart you, stay relevant and competitive in the digital age!**
